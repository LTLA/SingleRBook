This package exists only to compile the book on the Bioconductor build system.
It does so by stuffing the book into a package to make it fit into the build system's package-oriented framework,
with some additional tricks to coerce `R CMD build` to actually compile the book chapters.
If you're reading this vignette, you're probably trying to find something else:

- If you're looking for the compiled book itself, you should go to https://ltla.github.io/SingleRBook instead.
The compiled development version of the book is at https://ltla.github.io/SingleRBook-devel.
- If you're looking to edit the book, you should go to https://github.com/LTLA/SingleRBook-base.
This contains the source material from which all compiled versions are derived.
- If you're looking to mimic this set-up for another book, look at https://github.com/LTLA/SingleRBookWrapper.
This uses https://github.com/LTLA/TrojanBookBuilder to automatically transplant the book contents into the package.
