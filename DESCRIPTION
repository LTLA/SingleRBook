Description: 
    Serves as a vehicle to compile the SingleR book on the Bioconductor
    build machines. Book chapters are transplanted into the vignettes
    subdirectory where the build system can be deceived into compiling them.
    The compiled book is then available in the tarball for deployment on the
    site of your choice.
